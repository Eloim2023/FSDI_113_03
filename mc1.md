# Issue Manager Initial set up
Initialize your new Django project by setting up a few basic pages.

### Steps
1. Create a new django project in this directory
2. Create the following apps:
2.1. pages
2.2. issues
2.3. accounts
3. Generate support for two pages that must be accessible through a web browser:
3.1. Your home page, which should include basic information on the purpose of the app.
3.2. An "about us" page, which should contain details on a fictional company (app provider).

##  Note
Don't forget: don't run the default migrations.
