# Mini Challenge 2

Add support for the built-in auth urls.

## Steps
1. Add support for log in
1.1. Ensure that logged in users are redirected to the home page
2. Add support for log out
2.1. Ensure that users are either redirected somewhere (you choose) or support the default template
3. Add support for password change
4. Add support for password reset
4.1. Use the email mock server for this (no need to integrate with sendgrid for now)

## Note
Override the default templates for each of these views.
